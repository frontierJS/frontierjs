description: The named cross-package handoffs — who owns each translation between litestone, junction, sierra and the browser client. Use before grepping for a seam, or before adding to one — a gate copy, an error mapper, the result envelope, a directive, a schema keyword, a broadcast, a live store.

# Bridge index — the named cross-package handoffs

The current seams: reach for one before grepping, and add to its owner rather than beside it (Invariant 4). They may move, merge or change signature as long as ownership and dependency direction hold.

**One line per seam: name — what it answers — owner.** Before you change a seam or build on it, read its full entry in the section's reference file: the contract, what it refuses, who else reads it, and its ruling. `packages/cli/core/seams.js` parses the lines below — the section headings, the backticked names that open a bullet, and the owner as the first package path in the line. `fli check`'s `seam-owner` fails a stated owner that does not resolve, and `seam-listed` compares the names with the key list in the root `CLAUDE.md`.

**Accessor query** — the `db.$x(accessor, …)` family. An unknown accessor answers empty (*I cannot judge this* is not *this is wrong*), every client flavor answers the same (root, `$setAuth`, `asSystem`, `$scopedBy`), and a principal is passed as an argument rather than read off the client.

**Data → API**
Detail: `references/data-api.md`
- `$setAuth(user)` / `asSystem()` — the Data-boundary checkpoint, and its bypass — `litestone/src/core/client.js`
- `$tapEvents(fn)` — every write announced; `scope: 'row' | 'collection'` is stated by the write, never read off `result` — `litestone/src/core/client.js`
- `withLitestoneDb(db)` — the per-request scoped client on `ctx.locals.db` — `junction/src/core/litestone.ts`
- `gateAuth()` + `autoValidate()` — schema-derived 401s and 400s for model services — `junction/src/core/litestone.ts`
- `validateInput(type)` — the same 400 for a method no model describes, through `methods: [{ method, input }]` — `junction/src/core/litestone.ts`
- `customMethodGrade(method, declared, levels)` — what grades a custom method: `declared` · `floor` · `unchecked` — `junction/src/core/litestone.ts`
- `needsBackfill` — the middle step of an expand/contract split, found in the app's source by `fli release:check` — `cli/core/backfills.js`
- `sessionGateLevel(user)` — a session → the 0–7 scale, via `toolbelt/gate`'s `gradeStanding` — `junction/src/core/litestone.ts`
- `toDataPrincipal(user)` — a session → the principal `auth()` reads (`userId` → `id`) — `junction/src/core/litestone.ts`
- `bearerClaim({ from, model, column, claims, key, subject, session })` / `BEARER` / `bearerOf(ctx, model)` — the resolver for a caller with no session who still owns rows; `ctx.locals[BEARER]` is the first grant resolved in the app's stated order and `bearerOf` reads any; a session beside the grant is a 400 before the grant is read unless `session: 'merge'` (`FJS-D832`) — `junction/src/core/litestone.ts`
- `bearerClaim(...).mint(db, data)` / `.mintOnCreate()` / `.redeem(db)` — a grant minted by the caller's own create (the digest named in `system:`, `FJS-D819`) and a link redeemed for the httpOnly cookie `from: cookie()` reads (`FJS-D340`); the one place the key, purpose, model and column are stated — `junction/src/core/litestone.ts`
- `resolveTenancy(schema)` / `registry.tenantFor({host, headers, principal})` — the one reading of `tenancy { }` — `litestone/src/core/tenancy.js`
- `accessorCandidates()` — `model Post` ⇄ service `posts` ⇄ `db.post` — `junction/src/core/litestone.ts`
- `db.$checkWhere(accessor, where)` — is this a valid filter key; throws — `litestone/src/core/client.js`
- `db.$checkOrderBy(accessor, orderBy)` — is this a sortable key, with the reason when it is not; throws — `litestone/src/core/client.js`
- `db.$readAs(accessor, row, principal)` — the row as that principal would read it, for a broadcast; fails closed — `litestone/src/core/client.js`
- `db.$levelOf(accessor?, principal?)` — the level the app's own `getLevel` grades a caller at; `null` is *cannot grade* — `litestone/src/core/client.js`
- `db.$primaryKey(accessor)` — the key's columns in key order — `litestone/src/core/client.js`
- `db.$claimsFor(principal)` — the claims the schema reads off a row pointing at the caller — `litestone/src/core/client.js`
- `db.$protectedFields(accessor)` — which columns are guarded, encrypted or hashed — `litestone/src/core/client.js`

- `toFieldErrors(err)` — a thrown value → per-field messages — `sierra/src/resource/field-rules.js`
- `$context.form` — the form context every control resolves from; `reportInvalid` goes the other way — `ui/components/forms/Form.mesa`

- `retryable` — race or refusal on a 409, the one thing a status cannot carry — `junction/src/core/errors.ts`
- `buildTransitions()` / `transitionsAt()` — `x-transitions`, the gate half of a move; `refusedBy` — `sierra/src/resource/field-rules.js`
- `buildCommitments()` / `commitmentsAt()` — `x-commitments`, the date a `@system` move falls due — `sierra/src/resource/field-rules.js`
- `modelNameFor()` / `schemaFor()` — service name → model, over `toolbelt/inflect` — `sierra/src/resource/schema-registry.js`
- `authUserModel(db)` / `authMachineryModels(db)` — auth's two `.lite` files, split by owner — `auth/schema.ts`
- `extend model X { … }` — what an app says about a model it did not write; adds only — `litestone/src/core/parser.js`
- `attachments` — what the app needs and does not own, checked at startup against the environment — `junction/src/core/attachments.ts`

- Plugin protocol `{ name, register, boot, work, ready, shutdown, requires }` — `register` is sync, async setup goes in `boot()`, and anything on a clock (a worker, a poller, a timer) goes in `work()`, which `_startOnce()` skips so `junction call` and the snapshot tools start nothing (`FJS-D551`) — `junction/src/core/app.ts`

- `x-fjs-build` + the `connected` frame's `build` → `client.stale` — which build the browser is on — `junction/src/core/build-id.ts`
- `wsSend()` / `flushSendQueue()` — put this frame on that socket — `junction/src/transport/send-queue.ts`
- **A broadcast is GRADED per recipient, in cohorts** — `gradeRecipients` asks `$readAs` once per principal, and on a channel whose resolver answers no claim, again under each claim it answers for that principal on their other channels — `junction/src/transport/channels.ts`
- `announce()` hook + `app.channel(name)` — real-time; `callService` is the one announcement point — `junction/src/transport/channels.ts`

- `client.auth.*` — the browser half of `@frontierjs/auth` — `junction/src/client/index.ts`
- `signIn` → `completeSignIn(code)` — a session or a challenge; the client holds the ticket — `junction/src/client/index.ts`
- `client.auth.providers()` + `OAUTH_ERRORS` / `session.oauthMessage` — which providers exist, and what an OAuth error means — `junction/src/client/index.ts`
- `tokenStorage` on the client + `session` in sierra — one owner for the token, one shape for the session — `junction/src/client/index.ts`
- `client.nodes` / `resource.record(id)` — one node per row keyed by model; a list is a view — `junction/src/client/nodes.ts`
- `matchesQuery(fields, record, query)` — is a pushed record still in this list — `toolbelt/src/match/match.js`
- `$after` / `endCursor` / `resource.more()` — a live list grows a keyset window — `toolbelt/src/directives/directives.js`
- `comparatorFor(orderBy)` — the one reading of `orderBy` and `select` — `junction/src/core/query-values.ts`

**UI**
Detail: `references/ui.md`

- `renderComponent(src, opts)` — UI → HTML at build time — `mesa/src/render-component.js`

- `swapInstances(entries, newFn, newSetMark, label)` — the DOM a hot update replaces; no imports — `mesa/mesa-vite/swap.js`
- `island(anchor, Comp, props, block, meta)` — the island seam; markers are comments — `mesa/src/runtime.js`
- **The theme is a class on `<html>` and Sierra owns the switch** — `sierra.config.js` `theme: {}`
- **There is no cross-package reactivity registry.** — sierra passes `externalReactivityHints: 'strict'`
